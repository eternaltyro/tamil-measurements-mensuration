### Introduction to Measurement Systems

- Practical Measurements
- What are they used for?
- Types of Measurements
  - Unit measurement: Counts, Numbers and Fractions
  - Spatial::Length measurement: Lengths, heights and distances
  - Spatial::Area measurement: Land and water surface area
  - Spatial:: Volumetric: Solid volumes for grains and produce
  - Spatial:: Volumetric: Liquid volumes
  - Spatial:: Trigonometric: Angles
  - Temporal:: Small times: Everyday time
  - Temporal:: Seasonal times: Large spans
  - Temporal:: Age classifications
  - Spatial-temporal:: Velocity (speed). Did they understand distance per unit time?
  - Physical:: Mass / Balance Weight measures for grains
  - Physical:: Mass / Balance Weight measures for precious material (gold, gems)
  - Monetary:: Cash and currency

- Redundancy in units
- Multiplicants
- Fractions of units
- Relationship between units
- Surviving measures
- Timelines of evolution of measurement systems
- Directions (eight ?) and origins of directions
- Names of shapes and solids

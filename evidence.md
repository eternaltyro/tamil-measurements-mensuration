How do I believe this shit?
====

Most of the claims on the Internet about Ancient Indians' knowledge in the field of mathematics and sciences are baseless. There's a lot of unintentional disinformation in this area due to excessive pride and devotion to one's mother language. Documentations of scientific observations and mathematical data in ancient literature are quite sparse. But nonetheless, we do find mentions and explanations of such data in literature albeit in literature written using proto versions of
the language in question. 

So it's quite unfortunate that we are left to believe the interpretations of ancient texts by more contemporary scholars merely on the basis of their sheer authority on the subject. Most of the scholars, having done a fair bit of research in lingistics in general and specfic languages in particular, are quite credible. But many are not. We should use our better judgement to decide whether the research done by a specific scholar/researcher is sufficient enough for us to accept the results.
We should not hesitate to question the methods of research or interpretation or the reliability and consistency of a particular set of evidences.

In some cases we might be lucky enough to have physical non-textual evidences for measurement methods as in the case of Harppan civilizations where humanity has been able to dig out length measures and weight measures. We have been able to find similar measures in other places and compare them with each other. We know to a certain extent the ratio between these measures and we know (again to a certain extent) that these ratios are consistent among samples found in different sites. 

Another good proof of a certain measure is the same measure being discussed in different texts by different authors which gives us the idea that the units must have been so commonly in use that the authors casually mention it in various contexts. If we know the difference in time-scale of the two works of literature, we have an approximate scale of how long (at a minimum) those scales would have been in vogue.

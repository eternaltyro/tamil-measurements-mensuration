Systems of Measurement and Mensuration in Ancient and Contemporary Tamil

### Introduction

This project is an attempt to trace and understand the evolution of measurement and mensuration systems in [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamils) societies. As I understand, antiquated measurement systems used by Tamils could shed light on Tamil culture and traditions which are of historical significance.

Unfortunately, there's been very little effort to document the measurement and mensuration systems of ancient cultures. Also, documents of such systems are hard to find. Most times, we are left to rely on contemporary sources - sometimes even baseless, forwarded WhatsApp messages - with little evidence or citation to authentic literary sources.

Hopefully, by the time this project is close to completion, it will be a reliable documentation of measurement and mensuration systems along with citations to references in old Tamil literature that can be taken as evidence.
